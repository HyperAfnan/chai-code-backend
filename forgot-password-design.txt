Forgot password design

user sends post request with this data to the server
   { 
      "email": "the email"
   }

the forgot password validates of the email exists in the db or not
generates a new resetPasswordToken for the email, _id , username and sends to db

if yes, then it adds a email to the queue via email service 

email added to queue, worker gets the job, executes it 

if executes properly,

email is send to the user with the link to reset password
link will be like, https://someWebsite.com/resetPassword?=token

when the link is clicked, a web page, is opened with a new password field

when the new password is set, the page hits another endpoint with this data

{
   "resetPasswordToken": "resetPasswordToken"
   "new password": "new password"
}

then the controller changes the password via a db call
